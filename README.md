###### The Backend is deployed on aws - Elastic Beans, This might not work as it is required to deploy the front end as well and then run them on the same port to integrate
###### Also, there's a chance the environment is terminated so that we don't end up losing all the credits just yet.
* Deployed app on aws : http://rmit-booking-app.s3-website.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
